One of the more salient barriers to performing high-quality psychological research, especially in these times of pandemic and social distancing, is reproducibility.  Although the so-called "reproducibility crisis" is surely overblown and not nearly as crisis-ish as it is claimed, the fact remains that the foundation of science is in fact broad replicability of results, the better to nail down on the underlying "universal laws" beneath.  Of course, in PSychology, one quickly learns that there are no such laws, discounting chaos theory; reality may be deterministic at a molecular level, but at the level of the whole thinking, acting human, with literally uncountable influences from development, language, culture, affect, prior learning and any of the hundreds of other factors you can conceive of acting on a person at a given place and time, the concept of "laws" feels even a little quaint and naive.  By the same token, however, we cannot as a field allow a single study on a single population - most likely a convenience sample of PSychology undergrads at the same institution the researcher works at - to dictate theory and practice going forward.  Replication and standardization must become a higher priority if we intend to truly take our work to the next level.

However, I hear the responses saying, "Replication is hard!"  I can't deny that it is true.  Replicating studies takes time, which costs money, and may require specialized materials or apparatus that the original researcher has created, and may be reticent to share for one reason or another.  The predatory world of scientific publishing and the fear of being "scooped", of losing publishing privileges and the accompanying clout, the all important Nature Paper credential hanging upon one's wall and lauded in one's CV, does push things in undesirable directions.  Open science and access is a step in the right direction, but it will be years at best before these efforts show fruit in reducing the downsides of our capitalism-lite academic culture.

But, more to the point, what if replication could be made simpler?  Questions of sampling and individual differences will likely never be solved by but a single study alone, for the real answer there is to simply add more samples and more data points to the mix.   How can this be achieved, in a simpler, less costly way?  By bundling all assets and methods of a study together and freely disseminating them to the world, that an identical or consciously modified version of the same exact experiment may be simply and quickly deployed on a variety of populations.  All the better if it can be done online, as well; though the vagaries of the Internet Age have brought with them some negative aspects it has nonetheless significantly improved many people's access to institutions and researchers they might otherwise not have been able to attend or participate in research from.
